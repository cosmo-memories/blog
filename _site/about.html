      <h3 id="about-the-author">About The Author</h3>

<p>Hello! I’m David, but online I usually go by Cosmo. If you’ve ever met me elsewhere online you probably know me as “that weird guy who is way too into Final Fantasy”. I’m a thirty-something nerd from New Zealand and I like books, computers, video games, dragons, and lots of other things. I post about them sometimes on this blog to document my work and learning progress, and to prove to the world that I exist.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-site">About The Site</h3>

<p>Still in the progress of being set up, this blog is an archive of rambles and updates on various things that I do on the internet. Planned content includes: game development diaries, other software and web development, and opinion pieces on whatever I happen to be playing or reading.</p>

<p>This site is powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.</p>
