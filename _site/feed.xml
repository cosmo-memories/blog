<p>At this stage I have very little experience with Actual Practical Web Design that needs to be useable by humans, so one of the things on the agenda for the coming months is learning how to build things that are functional on mobile devices as well as desktop. You may notice the layout on my homepage currently doesn’t work on smaller screens at all. Please don’t look at my commit history. I will cry. I’m working on it.</p>

<p>I have also started learning Unity and C# on the side. I will definitely be sinking a lot more time into this and am very eager to do some game dev diary posts once I finish the tutorial projects I’m currently working on. I also miss Java! I have a growing list of small random projects I want to do. Maybe I’ll drop everything and do that instead! Who knows.</p>

<p>Anyway, the current site update roadmap is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Daily updates to the math reference page; continuing to add basic definitions, concepts, etc. These will be expanded later with explanations, proofs, and examples.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blog updates at least once a week. Hopefully this will help spur me to actually have things to write about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regular screwing around with layouts as I speedrun patching the holes in my web dev fundamentals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proper VPS hosting and custom domain(s) in ~3 months, if all goes to plan.</p>
  </li>
</ul>]]></content><author><name>Cosmo</name></author><category term="dev" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think I could probably spend the entire rest of my life fiddling around with CSS only to revert everything in the end anyway and have nothing to show for my efforts.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Memoria : Hello World: This is a Blog and I’m Making a Post</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/09/10/second.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Memoria : Hello World: This is a Blog and I’m Making a Post" /><published>2024-09-10T00:00:00+12:00</published><updated>2024-09-10T00:00:00+12:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/09/10/second</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/09/10/second.html"><![CDATA[<p>I want to see how the page layout handles slightly longer titles.</p>

<p>I’ve been very busy (and exhausted) the past few weeks so I haven’t had time to get this thing going like I wanted. I still need to add tag pages, fill out the About Me information, and actually finish the layout. I want to sink my teeth into some gamedev stuff for fun once I’ve relaxed a little, so that’ll give me something to post about, I suppose. I will also be (at some point) setting up some proper hosting with a custom domain so that I’m not tied to this Github URL.</p>

<p>I’m also working on another page (linked at the top) where I collect mathematics notes and concepts, along with examples, explanation, etc… eventually. There’s not a lot there yet, and it’ll take a long time to fill out. I’m still getting the hang of Jekyll but it seems really fantastic and easy to use!</p>

<p>I was planning to blog about gaming here too; I’ve finished my latest playthough of Final Fantasy IX and I have a LOT to say about it, especially in regards to XIV and Dawntrail. I’ll write something once I get those thoughts together and collect some good reference screenshots.</p>]]></content><author><name>Cosmo</name></author><category term="dev" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to see how the page layout handles slightly longer titles.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Memoria : First!!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/08/21/first.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Memoria : First!!" /><published>2024-08-21T00:00:00+12:00</published><updated>2024-08-21T00:00:00+12:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/08/21/first</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2024/08/21/first.html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello world!</p>

<p>First test post! Things are up and running!</p>

<p>Fun fact: if you live in New Zealand and are working just after midnight, Github might think you are posting from the future and refuse to publish your correctly-dated entries. You may waste a lot of time trying to troubleshoot this. I am having a great day, thanks for asking.</p>

<p>At least it works now! I think!</p>]]></content><author><name>Cosmo</name></author><category term="dev" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello world!]]></summary></entry></feed>
