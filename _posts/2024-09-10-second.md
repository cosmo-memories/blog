I want to see how the page layout handles slightly longer titles.

I've been very busy (and exhausted) the past few weeks so I haven't had time to get this thing going like I wanted. I still need to add tag pages, fill out the About Me information, and actually finish the layout. I want to sink my teeth into some gamedev stuff for fun once I've relaxed a little, so that'll give me something to post about, I suppose. I will also be (at some point) setting up some proper hosting with a custom domain so that I'm not tied to this Github URL.

I'm also working on another page (linked at the top) where I collect mathematics notes and concepts, along with examples, explanation, etc... eventually. There's not a lot there yet, and it'll take a long time to fill out. I'm still getting the hang of Jekyll but it seems really fantastic and easy to use!

I was planning to blog about gaming here too; I've finished my latest playthough of Final Fantasy IX and I have a LOT to say about it, especially in regards to XIV and Dawntrail. I'll write something once I get those thoughts together and collect some good reference screenshots.
