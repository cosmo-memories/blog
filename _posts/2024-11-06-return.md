Drowning in responsibilites and things to do, and on top of it all my cat is dying. I'm not having a great time.

Thankfully the immediate struggles are out of the way. I will be taking two more days to rest before I lock in and get back to coding. Going to be exploring better hosting solutions and some backend stuff. _Dragon Quest III_ HD-2D remake is out next week, two days after _Final Fantasy XIV_'s patch 7.1. I will be posting about those too!
