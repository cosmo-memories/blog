Hello world!

First test post! Things are up and running!

Fun fact: if you live in New Zealand and are working just after midnight, Github might think you are posting from the future and refuse to publish your correctly-dated entries. You may waste a lot of time trying to troubleshoot this. I am having a great day, thanks for asking.

At least it works now! I think!
