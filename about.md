### About The Author

Hello! I'm David, but online I usually go by Cosmo. If you've ever met me elsewhere online you probably know me as "that weird guy who is way too into Final Fantasy". I'm a thirty-something nerd from New Zealand and I like books, computers, video games, dragons, and lots of other things. I post about them sometimes on this blog to document my work and learning progress, and to prove to the world that I exist.

### About The Site

Still in the progress of being set up, this blog is an archive of rambles and updates on various things that I do on the internet. Planned content includes: game development diaries, other software and web development, and opinion pieces on whatever I happen to be playing or reading.

This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
